A Brief Introduction
=====================

Welcome to another installment of Reproducible Finance. Today’s post will be topical as we look at the historical behavior of the stock market after days of extreme returns and it will also explore one of my favorite coding themes of 2020 – the power of RMarkdown as an R/Python collaboration tool.

We thought it would be a nice project to post that Python code along with the equivalent R code for reproducing the same results. For me, it’s a great opportunity to use RMarkdown's R and Python interoperability superpowers, fueled by the reticulate package. If you are an R coder and someone sends you Python code as part of a project, RMarkdown + reticulate makes it quite smooth to incorporate that Python code into your work. It was interesting to learn how a very experienced Python coder might tackle a problem and then think about how to tackle that problem with R. Unsurprisingly, I couldn’t resist adding a few elements of data visualization.

Before we get started, if you’re unfamiliar with using R and Python chunks throughout an RMarkdown file, have a quick look at the reticulate documentation here.
